# COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL to uncover patterns, trends, and insights from the pandemic. The analysis includes key metrics such as case trends, vaccination rates, mortality rates, and recovery statistics across various regions. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my expertise in SQL for data analysis and my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

## Motivation

As a data enthusiast, I developed this project to showcase my SQL skills in organizing, querying, and analyzing large datasets. This project reflects my dedication to understanding real-world challenges and providing data-driven solutions. By exploring COVID-19 data, I aim to highlight my ability to work with structured data and provide meaningful insights that can support decision-making processes.

## Project Description

The project involves:

- **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using SQL to explore data trends and patterns.
- **Key Insights**: Identifying metrics such as:
  - Trends in daily cases and deaths.
  - Vaccination progress by region.
  - Recovery rates and their correlation with healthcare infrastructure.
  - Geographical comparisons of COVID-19 impact.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **SQL Querying**: Expertise in writing efficient SQL queries to manipulate and analyze data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing or inconsistent data to ensure accurate results.
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarizing large datasets to extract key insights.
- **Analytical Thinking**: Identifying patterns and trends to derive actionable conclusions.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressing real-world challenges through data-driven analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL**: For data querying, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Database Management System**: MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server (specify the DBMS used).
- **Excel/Python**: For additional data preprocessing or visualization (if applicable).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [reliable sources, such as WHO, John Hopkins University, or Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), providing comprehensive COVID-19 statistics.
